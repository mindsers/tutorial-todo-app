Must have:

- [x] show a list of todos (text, done state)
- [x] user can add a new todo to the list
- [x] user can remove a todo from the list
- [x] user can update a todo

Nice to have:

- [x] user can delete all the todos
- [ ] user can reorder the todos
- [x] user can create multiple list of todos
- [ ] user can see the todo in a kanban board (trello like)
- [ ] todos are complex entities (title, description, labels, due date)
- [ ] user can see his tasks for today
- [ ] user can prioritize todos
- [ ] user can add images to the todo
